Jarvis - A Voice Controlled AI Assistant 🧠🎙️
Jarvis is a Python-based voice-activated chatbot that functions like a virtual assistant. It can perform a range of tasks using simple voice commands — like opening websites, playing music, and reading news headlines. Inspired by Tony Stark’s iconic AI, this project brings basic automation to your desktop using speech recognition and a mix of helpful libraries.
